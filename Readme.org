#+TITLE: Gabe's Dotfiles

* How it works
[[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dotfiles][This ]] describes the method I am using (under Tracking dotfiles directly with
Git). It is just a git repo with a separate working tree so I don't have to have
a git repo in `$HOME`.

** Usage tips
*** View Untracked files
    Because we set =status.showUntrackedFiles= to =no= when we run =config
    status= we won't see newly added files that we may care about. So, to view
    newly added files in directories you care about you need to run =config
    status -unormal directory=. This tells git to showUntrackedFiles as normal
    and gives it the directory to look in so you don't see your entire working directory.
